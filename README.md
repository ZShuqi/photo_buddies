# Photo Buddies

Photobuddies is a website to tackle the pain points of amateur photographers’ difficulty finding buddies to practice photography skills. 

It creates a local photography community, enabling amateur photographers to share their work and get in touch with their community. Users can browse through people and art in their community, post photo galleries, share their favourite photo spots nearby, and participate in photography events.
